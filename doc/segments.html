Line segment properties
</H1>
The line segments that form patterns have various properties; most are simple on/off
 flags that are displayed by various symbols (unless this option is turned off).
 Line segment properties are:

  <UL>
  <LI><B>Invisibility</B>. Invisible lines segments are not drawn nor recursively
   replaced. They only connect other line segment. Invisible line segments are
   sometimes necessary for creating more interesting patterns; otherwise it would
   be impossible to create disjoint segment figures.

  <LI><B>Upside down</B>. If this property is set, the replacement
    of the line segment is mirrored in respect to the x-axis (x-axis meaning the
    axis that goes through the begin and end points of the line segment). The
    easiest way to see what this actually means is to change the state of this
    property, and let Fractlet draw the resulting fractal.

  <LI><B>Mirrored</B>.
   Similar to the above, if this property is
    set, the replacement is mirrored in respect to the middle point of the
    line segment. In practice this means 'switching' the begin and end point
    of the line segment. 'Upside down' and 'Mirrored' may be combined, and
    so there are basically 4 ways to do the replacement.

  <LI><B>Double-sided</B>: If this property is set, the line segment
    is 'replaced twice'; ie. it's equivalent to having 2 line segments that
    are otherwise identical, but the one has 'Upside down' property set and
    the other not. Use with care, as this slows down the drawing exponentially;
    often this property is used only on the first-level pattern.

  <LI><B>Final</B>:
    If this property is set, the line segment
    is final, ie. it will not be recursively repeated; it is as if its length
    had reached the limit. This property is often set for various short
    line segments, that would otherwise produce unwanted artifacts. Usually
    the alternative would be to make the line segment invisible.
