<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fractlet Help System</H1>

Fractlet is a simple Java-application that draws fractals
based on the line figures you define. It can be run both
as a stand-alone application and as an applet.
To be able to run it as an application you need to have
a Java Virtual Machine (JVM); this can be gotten from
JavaSoft (www.javasoft.com) and from various other sources.
To run it as an applet, your browser needs to support Java 1.1;
currently newer versions of Netscape Communicator (4.5 / 4.05
onwards) should do, as well as Internet Explorer 4 and 5.
At the time of writing, IE 5 with the JVM updates seems to
offer the best execution environment (sic!).
