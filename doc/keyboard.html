Fractlet keyboard operations
</H1>
Some operations can only be invoked via keyboard. All these operations modify
patterns, and thus the view panel of the main Fractlet window has to display
one of the patterns, not the fractal figure. In addition, the Fractlet window
has to have the keyboard focus; depending on the platform this may mean that
the mouse pointer is over the window, or that the main Fractlet window needs
to be clicked to let it have the focus.

The operations available are:

  <UL>
  <LI><B>Pattern rotation</B>. By pressing '*' and '/' (asterisk, or multiply, 
   and slash, or divide) buttons you can rotate the pattern along its center
   point. '/' rotates clockwise and '*' counterclockwise. The default rotation
   is one angle; you can increase the step to 5, 15 or 45 angles by pressing
   'shift', 'control' or 'alt' (respectively). Another way to rotate the
   pattern along a selected line segment end point is to select the end point,
   and then drag another end point while pressing 'ctrl'-key. This results in the
   pattern rotating along the selected end point, in the direction specified by
   mouse dragging. You can select more than one end point, in which case the middle
   point for rotation is the center (weighed center point) of the selected points
  (this means that if you selected all the points, the rotation is identical to
   normal rotation).
  <LI><B>Pattern scaling</B>. By pressing '+' and '-', you can enlarge or shrink
   the pattern. The default change is 4 percent enlargement/shrinking; you can
   do bigger changes by pressing 'shift'/'ctrl'/'alt' keys; this changes the step
   to 10, 25 or 50 percents.
  <LI><B>Pattern translation</B>. (or simply 'pattern moving'). By pressing one
   of the arrow keys, or the number keys on the number pad, you can move the pattern
   to the direction indicated. The default step is 1 pixel in the direction; this
   can be changed to 4, 16 or 64 pixels with 'shift'/'ctrl'/'alt'-keys.
  </UL>

  Note that keyboard operations are undoable (and redoable) like the normal
  menu / popup menu operations.
