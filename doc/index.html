<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fractlet Help System</H1>

Fractlet is a simple Java-application that draws fractals
based on the line figures you define. It can be run both
as a stand-alone application and as an applet.
<BR><BR>
To be able to run it as an application you need to have
a Java Virtual Machine (JVM); this can be gotten ie. from
JavaSoft (www.javasoft.com) as well as from various other sources.
To run Fractlet as an applet, your browser needs to support Java 1.1;
currently newer versions of Netscape Communicator (4.5 / 4.05
onwards) should do, as well as Internet Explorer 4 and 5.
At the time of writing, IE 5 with the JVM updates seems to
offer the best execution environment (sic!).

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H2>

Fractlet draws fractal figures based on one or
<A HREF="terms.html#pattern">patterns</A> (the terms are
explained in the <A HREF="terms.html">terminology page</A>),
which consist of number of points connecteded to each other.<BR>
The segments of the first-level pattern are replaced, one by one,
by another pattern, which may be the same pattern as the first level
pattern or different. The various patterns used are explained in section
<A HREF="patterns.html">'Patterns'</A>).<BR>
The replacement process is repeated recursively up to a configurable
threshold (by defualt, the limit is that the line segments that have
length of 1.0 or less are not replaced, but are drawn to the screen;
in addition, the maximum number of replacements per segment is defined
globally to be 99). The recursion limit, as well as various other
drawing properties, are explained in
<A HREF="ui.html">user interface</A> section.
<P>
A simple example is the fractal figure that you get if you simply
press Draw-button when Fractlet starts. The default line figure
looks like this:
<BR><BR>
<PRE>
       /\
      /  \
_____/    \_____
</PRE>
<BR><BR>

On the first round, each line segment is replaced by the same line
figure, and so we'll get something like:
<BR><BR>
<PRE>
     _/\_
    |    |
_/\_/    \_/\__
</PRE>
<BR><BR>
When this process is repeated to the limit, the resulting figure
is much more varied; you can easily test it by pressing 'Draw'.
<BR><BR>
The colours of the fractal figure are calculated using two
methods, which can be combined: the first uses the line angles,
and the second uses the level at which the line segment reached
the end-of-replacement limit. The exact procedure is explained in
section <A HREF="colours.html">'Defining colours'</A>)
<BR><BR>
And that's about it. Although the basic idea is very simple, the
resulting fractal figures are often quite complex. Fractlet comes
with a set of 'default fractal figures'; if you run Fractlet as
an application they can loaded from the sub-directory 'figures/',
if you run Fractlet as an applet, they can be selected from
the Choice-box on the control panel. Some small comments have
been added to fractals; be sure to check 'Figure Props'
('Props'-button on 'Figure'-part of the control panel) to view
them.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Usage</H2>

To understand the fractlet user interface, it's first necessary to 
understand how fractal figures are created from the patterns.
This is explained in section <A HREF="patterns.html">'Patterns'</A>.
<BR><BR>
The fractlet user interface (controls in the main fractlet window,
menus, popup menus) is explained in
<A HREF="ui.html">user interface</A> section.
<BR><BR>
There are also certain operations that can be invoked directly
from the keyboard (in some cases only from there, as there are no
menu or popup menu entries). These are explained in section
 <A HREF="keyboard.html">'Keyboard operations'</A>.
