<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Terms used by Fractlet Documentation</H1>

These terms are used by the documentation, and in  some
cases also by the user interface (in menu items etc):

<UL>
<LI><B>Pattern</B> means a sequence of connected points,
  a wire-frame figure. For example, the thing you see first
  in the main window when you start Fractlet, is pattern
  called "Main".
<LI><B>Segment</B> the lines that form patterns are called
  segments (or line segments, or lines).
  They connect the points that form patterns. Segments
  have various <B>properties</B>, that change the way
  fractals are drawn. Properties also directly affect
  the way segments are drawn in the window. More about
  properties in <A HREF="segments.html">segment-section</A>:
<LI><B>Figure</B> (or fractal figure) is the picture that
  is rendered based on the input patterns.
</UL>
