Patterns Fractlet uses
</H1>

Currently Fractlet can make use of 3 different patterns
when drawing the fractal figures.

<UL>
<LI><B>Main pattern</B> is the default pattern, used as
  the first level pattern (if no separate 1st level pattern
  is used) as well as for all the other levels (if no
  separate secondary pattern is used). When Fractlet
  is started (or 'New' is selected from a menu) this is
  the only pattern used, and is formed of 4 segments.
<LI><B>First level pattern</B> is not enabled by default.
  It can be enabled from the control panel, and when enabled
  for the first time, will be copied from the main pattern.
  It can be modified independent of the main pattern, and when
  drawing the fractal figure, is taken to be the initial
  pattern. Its line segments are then replaced using the
  main pattern (and possibly the secondary) pattern; it will
  not be used on other levels.
<LI><B>Secondary pattern</B> is not enabled by default.
  When enabled from the control panel for the first time,
  it will be copied from the main pattern (just like
  first level pattern). Secondary pattern will be used
  instead of the main pattern, on every second replacement
  level. Thus, if no separate first level pattern is used,
  the main pattern will be used as the initial pattern; then
  its line segments are replaced by a secondary pattern,
  the resulting line segments are replaced by the main pattern
  and so forth. If separate first level pattern is used, the
  order is 'first level pattern' -&gt; 'main pattern' -&gt;
  'secondary pattern' -&gt;  'main pattern' -&gt; and so on.
