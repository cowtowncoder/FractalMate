Colour generation
</H1>
The colours of the fractal figure are calculated from the colour palette
that can be selected using the 'colour'-panel in Fractlet control panel.
There are some predefined palettes, and you can also create a custom palette.
The palette is used to create a 'colour wheel', the colours from the palette
are located symmetrically, to the specified angles, and the in-between angles
are interpolated from these colours. Note that 256 colour mode may restrict
the actual number of colours Fractlet is able to use.

The operation of the colour selection window (which is opened when the
custom palette is chosen) should be straight-forward; the colours of the
palette are shown in boxes at the bottom of the window, the background colour
leftmost and then the actual fractal colours. There are on/off switches above
each foreground colour box, and they determine which colours are actually included
in the palette. The selected colour may be modified by moving the cursor in
the colour circle; this changes the 'hue' and 'saturation' of the colour
(in HSB/HSV - sense). The 'value' (or 'brightness') of the colour can be changed
from the sliders on the right of the colour circle. Alternatively you can also
modify the RGB-sliders, if you prefer modifying the colours via Red/Green/Blue
components.

The actual angles used for selecting colours are then calculated using 2
method: 'angle-based' and 'level-based' algorithms. Angle-based algorithm
uses the angle of the line segment directly for selecting the colour from the
colour wheel. The level-based algorithm takes the level in which the line segment
is drawn, and multiplies it by the 'colour shift'-factor (displayed and modified
in 'colour'-panel of the control panel); this defines the actual angle used for
selecting the colour. Both methods can be combined; the angle-based algorithm
can be turned on and off, and the level-based can be effectively disabled by
defining step of 0 degrees.
<BR><BR>
The method to use depends on the properties of the fractal figure. Generally,
for those fractals that converge fast, ie. where the longest segment is significantly
shorter than the end-to-end length of the pattern,
the angle-based is probably better. Similarly,  the patterns that have line segments
that have about equal line-lengths, the angle-based method may be better.
